    <h1>About the Author</h1>
    
    <p class="two">Hello Internet world! Welcome to The Film Around the Corner, a new Substack where I will be reviewing Old Hollywood films, and perhaps will be doing some other things too. Time will tell.</p>

    <div id=author>
    <p class="two">A little about me: I’m a recent college graduate who just got her Bachelor’s Degree in Film History and Criticism and Literature. My senior thesis was about Eddie Cantor pre-code musicals (<i>Whoopee!</i> (1930), <i>Palmy Days</i> (1931), and <i>Roman Scandals</i> (1933)) and how Cantor crafted a polysemous identity that challenged boundaries. At school, I was taught by some wonderful film historians and theorists and learned a lot about film criticism, which I got to adopt in my class papers that were typically on films from the Old Hollywood era such as <i>My Man Godfrey</i> (1936), <i>The Night of the Hunter</i> (1955), and <i>Meet Me in St. Louis</i> (1944), just to name a few (perhaps I will upload parts of these essays later?).</p>

    <p class="two">I grew up watching Old Hollywood movies such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals, Shirley Temple (my curls could have rivaled hers), Gene Kelly, and the Marx Brothers. This cemented my love for this time period and era, which I ended up pursuing actual education in once I attended college after a semester as a *shudders* theatre student.</p>

    <p class="two">Now, I am off to graduate school to pursue a Master’s Degree in Library and Information Science, with a concentration in Archives which I am absolutely thrilled about. But there’s a part of me that will miss writing about films and discussing them and the community that surrounds film theory and criticism. Enter The Film Around the Corner, a way for me to keep my passion for film, film history, and film criticism alive as I enter the next chapter of my life. My plans for this blog are to cover some of the weird and under-appreciated films from the Old Hollywood era as well as some classics. I want this blog to be fun and lighthearted, though there may come times where I’ll be tackling more difficult topics, as to be expected when dealing with films from this era. I hope you will join me and laugh along and the absurdity and fun that Old Hollywood has to offer!</p>
